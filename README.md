## Code Explanation

This application employs a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing web interface. 

- **HTML**: The structure of the application is defined in `index.html`, which contains the greeting message and the button.
- **CSS**: Styling is applied to enhance the visual presentation. Key aspects include:
  - A flexbox layout centers the content both vertically and horizontally.
  - A gradient background for the page and a semi-transparent white background for the container.
  - Rounded corners and a shadow effect for a modern look.
  - Button styling includes a gradient background and hover effects to enhance user interaction.
- **JavaScript**: The `handleClick` function is triggered when the button is clicked, displaying the alert message. This demonstrates basic interaction between HTML elements and JavaScript.

The application also includes responsive design principles, such as the viewport meta tag, ensuring usability across different devices.
