# Hello World Web Application

## Overview/Description
The Hello World Web Application is a simple web project designed to display a greeting message and provide an interactive experience through a button click. By default, it greets users with "Hello, World!" but also allows for dynamic changes to the greeting based on query parameters in the URL. This project serves as a foundational example for beginners looking to understand the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Displays a default greeting message: "Hello, World!"
- Supports dynamic greeting changes through URL query parameters
- Interactive button that alerts users when clicked
- Clean and modern design with centered layout and responsive styling

## Setup Instructions
To set up the Hello World Web Application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hello-world-web-app.git
   cd hello-world-web-app
   ```

2. **Open the project in your preferred text editor or IDE.**

3. **Open `index.html` in a web browser:**
   You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or right-click and choose to open it with a web browser of your choice.

## Usage Guide
- Open the application in a web browser to see the default greeting message.
- Modify the URL by adding a query parameter (e.g., `?greeting=Hello%20Universe`) to change the greeting displayed on the page.
- Click the button to see an alert that confirms the button click.

## Code Explanation
This project consists of three main components:

1. **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file contains the markup structure of the web page, including the greeting message and the button.

2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS ensures that the layout is centered on the screen with a clean design. It employs styles such as rounded corners and subtle shadows to enhance visual appeal.

3. **JavaScript Interactivity**: 
   - The `handleClick()` function is triggered when the button is clicked, displaying an alert box.
   - The `handleQueryParams()` function is responsible for checking the URL for a 'greeting' query parameter and updating the greeting message accordingly. Note that this function should be invoked during the page load to ensure the greeting updates as expected.

This combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides users with an engaging experience while also serving as an educational tool for those new to web development.
