## Code Explanation
This web application consists of three main components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. **HTML**: The `index.html` file contains the structure of the application, including a heading that displays "Hello, World!" and a button.

2. **CSS**: Styles are applied to enhance the layout and appearance. The use of Flexbox centers content within the viewport, while a linear gradient background makes the interface more inviting. The button is styled with gradients and hover effects to improve user interaction.

3. **JavaScript**: The `handleClick()` function is linked to the button, providing dynamic feedback when the user interacts with it. This showcases a basic interaction model that is fundamental for web applications.

Overall, this project exemplifies how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to create a responsive and interactive user experience.
